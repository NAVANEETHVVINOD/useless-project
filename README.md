Project Description
Kanya is a dating application designed for pets, allowing pet owners to create profiles for their furry friends and find compatible matches. The platform enables swiping, profile exploration, and interaction between pet owners, providing a fun and engaging way to connect pets socially.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Finding love is already complicated, but finding a perfect match for your pets is even harder. There‚Äôs no dedicated platform where pets can ‚Äúchoose‚Äù their friends or future playmates based on their personalities.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Kanya introduces a swiping-based pet matchmaking system, allowing pet owners to browse profiles, like or pass potential matches, and schedule meetups for their pets‚Äîall within a smooth, modern web app experience.
