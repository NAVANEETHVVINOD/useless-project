(Solo Project – because who needs a team when you can build chaos alone?)

Project Description
Kanya is the world's most unnecessary yet highly entertaining dating app for pets.
Because apparently, belly rubs aren’t enough – now even dogs and cats need to swipe left and right to find "true love".

(Warning: This app may cause jealousy among humans because your dog might get a date before you do.)

The Problem (that doesn’t exist)
Pets are lonely. They cry, they bark, they meow... but what they really need is a Tinder experience.
For too long, pets have been denied the chance to reject other pets based on looks alone – just like humans do every day.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing Kanya, the first platform where pets can:

Swipe left on smelly dogs 🐕

Swipe right on cats that hate you just enough 😼

Find "purr-fect" matches and maybe even go on a walk date in the park.

Basically, it’s Bumble but with more barking and fewer bad pickup lines.

Technical Details
For Software:
Languages: Python, JavaScript

Frameworks: Flask (Backend), Nuxt 3 (Frontend)

Libraries: Tailwind CSS, Pinia (State Management)

Tools: Git, VS Code, Google Images (for stealing cute pet pics 🐶😼)

For Hardware:
A laptop,

A mouse for swiping (your dog can’t use a touchscreen yet),

Optional: Dog treats for beta testing.
