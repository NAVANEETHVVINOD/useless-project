Project Description
Kanya is a fun and interactive dating app designed exclusively for pets. It allows pet owners to create adorable profiles for their furry friends, swipe through other pets, and find the perfect playdate or companion. Built as a light-hearted project, Kanya showcases creativity and tech skills in a unique way.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Pets around the world are bored and lonely because they can't find a perfect furry friend to match their vibes. Why should humans have all the fun with dating apps?

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Kanya solves this ‚Äúcritical‚Äù problem by giving pets their own Tinder-like experience where they can:

Create a profile with cute pictures.

Swipe left or right on other pets.

Find their ‚Äúpaw-fect‚Äù match!
