Project Description
Kanya is a fun, interactive dating web application designed exclusively for pets. It allows pet owners to create cute profiles for their furry friends, swipe through other pets, and find perfect matches for friendship or companionship.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Pets have been struggling to find their "paw-fect" companion because there's no Tinder for them. They sit at home bored, dreaming of the day they can swipe right on their next best friend.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Kanya gives pets their own Tinder-inspired app. Pet owners can upload images, browse other pets, and swipe right to find playdates, walks, or simply a new furry buddy.
