✨ About the Project
Pet Tinder is a fun web app designed to let pets swipe left or right to find their soulmate (or just a partner-in-crime for stealing snacks). Inspired by Bumble and Tinder, but for furry friends.
This is a hackathon-style project built just for fun, not to replace real-world pet adoption services.

🎯 Features
✅ Swipe left or right to like or dislike potential pet matches
✅ See cute pet profiles with names, age, breed, and sarcastic prompts
✅ “See More Details” button for extra info (because love is complicated 🐕🐈)
✅ Mobile-friendly & desktop-friendly UI
✅ Smooth drag-and-swipe interactions like Bumble
✅ (Optional) Funny match modal when two pets “like” each other

🐾 How It Works
1️⃣ Open the app → The first pet card appears.
2️⃣ Swipe right (like) or left (nope) using touch or mouse drag.
3️⃣ Click See More Details for extra info on the pet.
4️⃣ If two pets “like” each other → you get a “Match” modal.
5️⃣ Keep swiping until you run out of pets (because love is hard to find).
